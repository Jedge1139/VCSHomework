Creating a fork in the repostiory makes a copy of repostiory which then can be used to propose changes within the repository or experiment with adding new code to the project without affecting the orginal prject.

Pulling requests allow you to tell others about changes you have pushed to a repository that can be reviwed and disscued as well as changed before being merged into the reposoitory.
